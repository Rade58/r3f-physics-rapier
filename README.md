# Physics and RigidBody taga

We nest our meshes in Physics tag and we wrap our floor mesh in fixed RigidBody and for example we wrap sphere mesh in dynamic RigidBody

- We don't have to update the physics in each frame
- Three.js objects are automatically associated with the corresponding RigidBody Surrounding them
- React Three Rapier creates a physics shape matching the Three.js objects
- We don't have to specify surface properties, object mass, gravity, etc.
