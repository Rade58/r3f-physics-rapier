# Physics and RigidBody taga

We nest our meshes in Physics tag and we wrap our floor mesh in fixed RigidBody and for example we wrap sphere mesh in dynamic RigidBody

- We don't have to update the physics in each frame
- Three.js objects are automatically associated with the corresponding RigidBody Surrounding them
- React Three Rapier creates a physics shape matching the Three.js objects
- We don't have to specify surface properties, object mass, gravity, etc.

# Colliders

Shapes that make up our RigidBody

## To better see colliders use `debug` attribute on Physics tag

you will see shapes of rigid bodies (colliders)

we use this during development

also you will have a lot of wireframes because of this and thiat can impact performances

The wireframe you can see around rigid body is a collider

for example for our sphere collider will be cube (**cuboid** to be precise) by default (because cubes are default)

cuboids are addaptable (you will see this if you change the scale of the mesh, you will see that cuboid will adapt)

**If you have non cuboid shape, a rectangular shape for example, cuboid will adapt and you will see wireframe encapsulating perfectly that shape**

## Composed objects

We can put multiple meshes inside one RigidBody tag

try putting cube and sphere from our example, with debug enabled

# For better visualization

Go to <https://bruno-simon.com/#debug> to see all colliders on his website

just move car and in lil gui you will see physics; there you can check `modelsVisible`; I guess this will set debug on Physics tag

## Switching from default cuboid to ball

just set up `colliders="ball"` on RigidBody

## Hull collider

`colliders="hull"`

It's like putting elastic membrane around object. We tested this with torus

## Trimesh collider

`colliders="trimesh"`

hull is sometimes not good enough, because "elastic thing" doesn't follow crevice for example

this is visible with torus and a ball, ball will fall inside torus crevice

**But this is bad for performances, and you shoud avoid using it with rigid bodies that have `type="dynamic"`**

Colliders generated with a trimesh are empty on the inside and it makes collision detection more complicated and prone to bugs
A fast object might get through the trimesh or end up stuck on its surface

# Custom Colliders

make sure to use `colliders={false}`

We nest these in RigidBody tag, and their args array will determine dimensions (we tested bunch of these with our torus)

- BallCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/Ball.html>
- CuboidCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/Cuboid.html>
- RoundCuboidCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/Round Cuboid.html>
- CapsuleCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/Capsule.html>
- ConeCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/Cone.html>
- CylinderCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/Cylinder.html>
- ConvexHullCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/ConvexPolyhedron.html>
- TrimeshCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/TriMesh.html>
- HeightfieldCollider <https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/Heightfield.html>

avoid setting position and totation on mesh, do it on RigidBody; **this is because you can mess up position and rotation**

scale isn't supported on the rigid body

**You can also nest multiple custom collodiers in RigidBody**

# Access body and apply forces

You need refrence, so we will use `useRef` hook with RigidBody

And we use reference to apply `impulse`

**Available methods you can apply on `RapierRigidBody` instance:**

<https://rapier.rs/docs/api/javascript/JavaScript3D> (look for Methods) (try them out and you will be aware what they do so you can apply them in your projects)

- addForce is used to apply a force that lasts for quite a long time (like the wind)
- applyImpulse is used to apply a short force for a very short period of time (like for a projectile)

To make something jump, we'd better use applyImpulse

## For rotation, search for `torque`

The keyword for a rotation is torque
addTorque (equivalent of addForce)
applyTorqueImpulse (equivalent of applyImpulse)
Let's use the applyTorqueImpulse

# Object settings

You can control friction, restitution, mass, gravity, where the object are, where they are supposed to go, **and much more**

## Gravity

default is `- 9.81`

We can change this on `Physics` tag, like I did

You use **negative values for y**, and x and z should be 0, which makes sens since gravity pulls you down

if you want to create effect where all objects are sucked up to the sky you would set `y` to be positive by some value

or you can change x or z if you want objects to be sucked by these sides

### `gravityScale`

if you want specific rigid body to have different gravity than the rest, you can specify it

you can use negatives to change direction

### YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE GRAVITY STUFF AT RUNTIME

I had problem with changing gravity scale because something internaly happens

I am able to change gravity scale only few seconds after realod

What happens is that collider wirefram changes color few moments after reload. After it changes color me changing gravity scale doesn't affect anything. **I THINK THIS IS SOME INTERNAL SETTING WHERE GRAVITY IS LOCKED**
